Made by Ashkan in 2014, this is one of his websites. He considers this his best website ever as it was both visually pleasing and satisfying to complete. He found his inspiration from his time at Madison and his experience working at a Domino's. Bits and pieces of the code were used from codepen.io. However, a majority of the code was organically created by Ashkan for the user.
